# PEPRS - Performance Enhancement for Processing Radio Signals
PEPRS is a Spring 2018 Co-op project that aims to streamline the process of running signal processing algorithms. It also helps developers use algorithms developed by other people. It can perform RX calibration, TX calibration, and DPD.

## Installation Procedures

Installation requirements:
- MATLAB 2018 and up
   - Instrument Control Toolbox
   - Python drivers
   - matplotlib
- Qt 5.11.1
    - XCode (for Mac)
- Python 3.6.5
- PyQt5
- Keysight Libraries & Command Expert

To install MATLAB, visit: https://www.mathworks.com/downloads/ 
If a license is needed, visit the IST Webstore: https://cas.uwaterloo.ca/cas/login?service=https%3a%2f%2fstrobe.uwaterloo.ca%2fist%2fsaw%2fwebstore%2f 
The research license should automatically come with the instrument control toolbox.
If you're experiencing error messages related to the MATLAB path or installation it may be because your MATLAB path is incorrectly entered in your system environment variables.

To install Python, visit: https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-365/. 
Make sure to install a version that is compatible with your MATLAB version (64-bit or 32-bit). In the installation wizard, check the field that adds the python directories to your PATH. Make sure to add the directories to your system environment variables as well as your local PATH so python can be used as an admin.
To change the Python version you're using, remove all of the unwanted version paths from the environment variables.

To install Qt, visit: https://www.qt.io/download. 
In the installation wizard, make sure the correct version of Qt is selected to be installed. The most recent version is not selected by default.
If your Qt installation one day stops working/opening your .pro files, you might need to completely uninstall Qt and then reinstall it.

To install PyQt5, visit: https://www.riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/download5
If your PyQt installation isn't working it may be because your Python version is incompatible with PyQt. Python 3.4 is incompatible with PyQt.

To install MATLAB Python drivers, follow this link: https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_external/install-the-matlab-engine-for-python.html 
Administrator privileges are most likely needed to run the `python setup.py install` command. It is therefore important to make sure your python directories are in the system environment variables (for Windows) and that your python and MATLAB bit versions are the same. If you need to reinstall Python, make sure to reinstall PyQt5 as well.

To install matplotlib, run: `pip install matplotlib`

To install the Keysight IO Libraries and add ons, follow this link: https://www.keysight.com/en/pd-1985909/io-libraries-suite?cc=US&lc=eng

## Using MATLAB with Python
### Method 1: Import MATLAB engine into python
Documentation on the engine: https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_external/start-the-matlab-engine-for-python.html
To use this method, you must have the python drivers installed. It will only work on computers with a MATLAB license.
```
import matlab.engine
eng = matlab.engine.start_matlab()
eng.Function_Name(parameter,nargout=#)
```
### Method 2: Creating Python packages
In order to create and use a Python library from MATLAB code, follow this link: https://www.mathworks.com/help/compiler_sdk/gs/create-a-python-application-with-matlab-code.html
If you use this method, method 1 will no longer work. You cannot use MATLAB compiler-generated software components within a running instance of MATLAB (which is what the engine is). This method does not require the user of the application to have MATLAB installed as it relies on MATLAB Runtime. When creating a package, do not include the runtime installer in the package but use the web option instead. The installer is very large and makes the repository very buky.
### MATLAB Runtime
To install MATLAB Runtime: https://www.mathworks.com/products/compiler/matlab-runtime.html
For details: https://www.mathworks.com/help/compiler/deployment-process.html
The first time a Python package is created, you will be prompted to install MATLAB Runtime. Anyone else using the app needs to install it as well.
### MATLAB on Mac
Make sure MATLAB Runtime is installed
Append the path given by the installation wizard to the DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable. This can be done in terminal with `export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=path` . To check your path, run `echo $DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH`
To run a script from terminal, mwpython has to be used: https://www.mathworks.com/help/compiler_sdk/python/integrate-.html

## How to Use the GUI
### Copying the Repository
The repository can be located in the working drive in the 'peprs' folder. Clone this repo to your local computer using the command `git clone W:\peprs`
The typical git commands can be used:
```
git pull
git push
git add
git commit
```
For more information on git, visit this link: https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Git-Basics

### Starting the GUI
To start the GUI, there are two possible methods. 

1. Open the 'main.py' file in your file explorer 
2. Open command prompt (windows) or terminal (mac). Navigate to your cloned repository (using the cd command) and run `main.py`. Command prompt will allow you to see extra feedback typically displayed in matlab when running scripts. This information is not always displayed in the GUI.

### Welcoming Dialog
After running main, the first thing that appears is a dialog window asking you to choose your desired DUT setup. Currently, the only option that is accessible and functional is the SISO DUT.

### Next Steps and Help
Throughout the GUI, there is a 'Next Step' section that will prompt you on what action you should take if you ever need guidance. There are also help buttons next to some of the parameter fields. They display tooltips when hovered over that provide more details about a field.

### Dashboard Tab
The dashboard tab is the landing page after the DUT setup is selected. It shows the setup of the equipment workbench.

### Step 1 - Set Equipment
The Set Equipment tab is where equipment parameters are configured. For example, the center frequency of the AWG and UXA can be set. Different instruments can be navigated to via the dashboard in the top left corner. You must follow the next steps workflow in order to set/access all of the equipment e.g. the VSG settings must be successfully set before the VSA settings can be reached/navigated to. However, you can visit previously set equipment in any order at any time. Equipment that is accessible will have a hand cursor rather than an arrow and will change colour on hover.
**Note**: If a power meter isn't used in the current bench setup, the section can be bypassed by clicking 'Set' when it has an unfilled parameter. The Spectrum Analyzer then becomes accessible even though an error warning is given.

### Step 2 - Set Measurements & Calibrate
In this tab, measurement related parameters are set and so are calibration parameters. The VSA section should be filled out first so RX Calibration will be completed before TX Calibration (if applicable). Like the Step 1 tab, the dashboard in the top left corner is used to navigate to different instruments, make sure to follow the Next Step prompts! Performing calibration is optional: VSA calibration can be selected with a checkbox and VSG calibration with a dropdown. However, you must set the measurement parameters of the equipment. If calibration is not selected, only the measurement parameters will be shown or enabled, otherwise both calibration and measurement parameters are displayed. If calibration is run, the results of the calibration will be shown in the results panel on the bottom half of the screen. A 'Calibration Workflow' tab is located in the results section for guidance on how calibration files are used in the different scripts.

### Step 3 - Set & Run Algorithms
In the Set & Run Algorithms tab, algorithm related parameters are set. Three algorithms can be run: Calibration Validation, Precharacterization Setup, and DPD. If no calibration files were generated in Step 2, calibration validation will be inaccessible. Similar to Step 2, as the algorithms are run, graphs are shown in the bottom half of the page.

### Enabling/Disabling Safety and Quality Checks
In the top menu bar under Preferences, there is the ability to enable or disable the safety and quality checks. These checks appear before you can move to the Step 2 tab or the DPD tab respectively. These checks are to make sure that you have thought through your parameters before performing actual measurements.

### Opening and Saving Parameter Settings
In the top menu bar under File, there is the ability to save and open parameter setups. The appropriate text fields, drop downs, checkboxes, and radio buttons will be set to the appropriate value when saved and loaded. However, you will still have to set all of the appropriate buttons in the GUI i.e. push the "Set" or "Set & Run" buttons.

### Code Structure/Layout
There are 11 python files:
- main.py: contains the setup for all the signals and slots of the GUI components
- peprs.py: generated from peprs.ui, the main window of the application
- dutsetup.py: generated from dutseup.ui, contains the opening dialog to select the type of DUT
- qualitycheck.py: generated from qualitycheck.ui, contains the check that is presented before runnning DPD
- safetycheck.py: generated from safetycheck.ui, contains the check that is presented before going to Step 2
- setParameters.py: contains functions that are called when a "Set", "Update", "Update & Run," or "Set & Run" button is clicked
- updateButtons.py: contains functions that are called when a parameter field is changed and an update button needs to be enabled
- windowFunctions.py: contains functions that are called when tabs are changed, the window is resized, or the menu buttons are used
- workflowNav.py: contains functions that are called when buttons in the dashboard are clicked
- debugFunctions.py: contains functions that are called when a debug button is clicked
- paramaterFunctions.py: contains functions that are called when a parameter is changed

### DPD, RX Calibration, TX Calibration, Utility Functions, Instrument Functions
These are the same repositories from Test and Measurement Code on the working drive.

#### Equipment Setup, Measurement Data, DPD Data
These folders contain relevant data for their respective steps. For example, they contain calibration results and MATLAB structure files.

#### Step Functions
The folders titled 'Step 1 Functions', 'Step 2 Functions', and 'Step 3 Functions' contain the functions that are called in each respective step.
- Step 1 Functions contains the MATLAB functions that are called in setParameters.py. These functions send SCPI commands to the equipment
- Step 2 and 3 Functions contain MATLAB functions for setting parameters as well as for debugging purposes, many of these functions take python dictionaries as input arguments which are converted to MATLAB structs so that the GUI parameters can be used in MATLAB functions

#### Other Folders/Files
- C++ Code: contains files automatically created by Qt, they are irrelevant
- _ _pycache _ _ : is created when python opens main.py, it is irrelevant and regenerated whenever main is run
- icons: contains images used in the GUI
- Figures: contains saved images of the plots that are embedded into the GUI

### Qt
Qt applications are intended to be coded in C++. However, for this GUI, everything is written in Python. 
Qt is used to create the structure/layout of the GUI (i.e. all of the widgets, compoenents, text etc.) in the 'peprs.ui' file. This UI file is created using Qt Designer (installation instructions shown above) which is a simple drag and drop interface. This file is then converted into the 'peprs.py' file using the following command:
```
pyuic5 -x peprs.ui -o peprs.py
```
Make sure you run the pyuic5 command after all gui changes to ensure that they take effect and are represented in the Python code.
The 'peprs.py' file is called in 'main.py' and initiated as ```self.ui```. Widgets/components can then be referenced in main.py with self.ui. For example, `self.ui.algoTabs` refers to the Step 3 tabs containing calibration validation, precharacterization setup and DPD. The components have a variety of functions that can be used to add functionality to the GUI (see 'Explanations on Signals and Slots' in the Resources section). Some examples are below:

```
self.ui.algoTabs.currentIndexChanged.connect(functionName) # when the tab's index changes, call functionName
idx = self.ui.algoTabs.currentIndex() # what is the current tab object's index? useful for if statements
self.ui.lineEdit.textChanged.connect() # if a textfield is changed, call a function
text = self.ui.lineEdit.text() # return self.ui.lineEdit's current text
```

#### Common Widgets

- Stacked Widget: Used to show changing content in the same area 
   - e.g. each equipment page in step 1 is a separate page in a stacked widget, the next step sections are made from stacked widgets
   - can use `currentIndex()`, `currentIndexChanged()`, `setCurrentIndex()`, to easily manipulate these widgets and thus the GUI contents   
- Combo box: drop down lists
- Line edit: text fields
- Tabs
- Splitters: provide draggable bar to expand or collapse certain GUI sections
- Horizontal/Vertical Spacers: provides dynamic spacing for GUI components
- Horizontal/Vertical/Grid Layout: aligns components in the corresponding setup, works dynamically

#### Resources
Qt has very thorough documentation that can be found here: http://doc.qt.io/
PyQt also has documentation albeit not as nice: http://pyqt.sourceforge.net/Docs/PyQt5/
Fortunately, there are plenty of online miscellaneous PyQt tutorials that can be found.

A walkthrough of PyQt: https://www.tutorialspoint.com/pyqt/index.htm

Explanations on Signals and Slots:

- http://doc.qt.io/archives/qt-4.8/signalsandslots.html
- https://wiki.qt.io/New_Signal_Slot_Syntax
- https://wiki.qt.io/How_to_Use_Signals_and_Slots

**Note**: Qt's signals and slots system was changed recently in version 5. There is documentation for Qt4 and Qt5 so keep this in mind.

A nice tutorial on threading in PyQT: https://nikolak.com/pyqt-threading-tutorial/
**Note**: Uses the old version of signals and slots from Qt4

## Deploying Qt Applications
To deploy a Qt app, follow this documentation: http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/deployment.html
To create a python exe file to use during deployment, choose one of these methods: https://wiki.python.org/moin/PyQt/Deploying_PyQt_Applications
The application will be statically deployed, so it is very important that the correct qt version is installed

## Setup a Git Repo on a Server
This link shows how to setup a repo on a remote server: https://gist.github.com/joahking/780877
Some useful commands for this task:
`git remote -v` lists all of the current remotes setup for the repository
`git remote rm remote-name` removes the remote "remote-name" from the repo
`git remote new remote-name` adds a new remote called "remote-name"
`git --bare init` create a bare repository
`git config --bool core.bare true` configure repo as a bare repository

## Miscellaneous Resources

Markdown Guide: https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/technical-writing/markdown-guide/#table-of-contents-toc

Convert README.md to html file: https://dillinger.io/?utm_source=zapier.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=zapier
Dillinger makes very nice readmes, at the time I tried the site was down so StackEdit was used instead: https://stackedit.io/
StackEdit also automatically adds a table of contents depending on the export option you select
There are also command line tools that can be installed that allow you to do this.
